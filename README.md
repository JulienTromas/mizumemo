# Concept

Mizumemo is a web app to help people care for their real plants. Users can create their own plant collections, choosing from a database a plant they want to add to their own collection, after buying it in real life for example. They can choose to give a surname and indicate the date they bought their new green friend.

Each plant has its own watering interval information. Once the user indicates he watered its plant, the watering timer is reset. Once it reaches the watering interval indicated in the database, the user knows it's time to water their leafy companion!


# Technology and Architecture

Created with React and Firebase


# Current features
---

Currently in MVP state, users can do the following:

- Access the plant database
- Choose one to add to their own collection
- Give a surname and the 'bought date'
- View their own collection
- Indicate if they have just watered their plants and see the watering indicator turn green if they do so
- See the indicator turn red if they should water their plant soon


# Future Features
---

In the future, users will be able to:
- Login and have their own accounts
- Add pictures of their plants
- Share their collections with their friends and partners, so they can water each other plants if needed

... and much more!
